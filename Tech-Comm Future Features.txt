This is basically a list to mark advanced features to be considered for later implementation
Geoscape
* Option to get a country back after they signed a pact with aliens
* "landedMarker" for UFOs
* Terror missions can now be defined to take place in regions with XCom bases

Basescape
* Facilities can now require items to build
* Base building can now prevent building other buildings 
* trainingRooms
* refundValue
* manufacture - requiresBaseFunc
* research - requiresBaseFunc

Battlescape
* terrains - fuseTimers

Intelpedia
* Added a ruleset option to replace fuel capacity with range calculations in craft pedia articles
* 


* Pilots can't be recruited anymore but need to be trained using technicians, and the base  needs to have a training station and a hangar to enable pilot training there
* Training Stations also allow for soldiers to train their stats
* Hangars allow for 5 craft
* To manufacture craft you'll need to have either a Hangar or a Tech Station in your base
* The larger and more advanced stations (Defense, Tech, Comm) will also require to build Power Station facility in the base (too much requirements?)


Researching/acquiring/manufacturing craft will be one of the main efforts of Tech-Comm and the system I've came up with the following ideas:
* Starting craft on the base will be mainly high-tech models (Warthog, Prowler, Osprey)
* You can purchase some crafts but they'll arrive inoperable since they were recovered from crash sites, etc., and you'll need to have your engineers repair them in a Hangar (new 3x3 base facility) before you can use them
* To manufacture craft from zero you'll need to acquire either blueprints or prototypes from research/missions. You'll start with some blueprints of low tech craft
* Repairing/manufacturing craft will require supplies and, in some cases, materials that can only be recovered from HK crash sites (electronics, engines, etc.)
* Repaired/Manufactured craft can be sold back to the Resistance with a profit margin

Staff
* The Resistance soldiers present during missions will rejoin Tech-Comm (if they survive)
* Techs/Specialists can be recruited from civilians rescued from Workcamps or Eradication missions 
*
