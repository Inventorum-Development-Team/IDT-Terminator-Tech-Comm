V0.34
* Change: new maps for Command Center and Hangar, added stairs to Housing and Stores buildings, fixed routes to prevent terminators becoming stuck on roofs, and a rework of nearly all existing maps
* Add: Medical Station, heals 5% health of injured soldiers, can host 25 personnel
* Add: Training Station, up to 10 soldiers can be assigned, can host 25 personnel
* Add: Pilot Training, requires base funcionalities pilot_training and craft_housing, uses 1 manufacturing space, takes 5-15 days to complete
* Add: Craft Production, requires base funcionalities craft_housing and craft_production and the corresponding craft research project
* Change: Shelter and Hangar give craft_housing base funcionalities, Hangar and Tech Station give craft_production, and Hangar/Training Station give pilot_training
* Add: destroyBaseFacilities as a global variable, set to true. This makes enemy units to focus more on destroying base facilities during a base defense mission
* Add: all facilities now have a missileAttraction value assigned, representing the odds of getting hit by a bombardment. Surface buildings and radar/missile facilities have higher values, while underground facilities have lower ones
* Crafts can be acquired according through 3 ways: purchase (most already existing craft), research & manufacturing (recovering blueprints on missions) and recovery (winning tactical missions). Research unlocks the existing advanced craft, while the newer models added can only be recovered from missions

* Change: craft Intelpedia articles now display range instead of fuel
* Change: additional options are now fixed, specifically storageLimitsEnforced (false), drawEnemyRadarCircles (false), removeWoundedFromTraining (true) and strafe (false)

V0.33
* Add: Automatic Base Upgrades - HK Bases spawned by Factories start as Outposts and will upgrade to a full base after a couple months. Outposts will have a smaller battlescape (40x40) instead of the planned 50x50 for HK Bases, and will only spawn Eradicaton and Patrol missions. After being upgraded to HK Bases they'll spawn Termination and Interdiction missions in addition to the other two.
* Change: Eradication missions generate resistance alerts (which disappear soon and which don't change score). The alerts' propose is to reveal machine presence in the area and help with overall immersion since it's nearly impossible to respond to them.
* Add: Geoscape Alert System using missionScripts. New objectives will appear as Geoscape alerts when they are activated and a detailed description becomes available at the Intelpedia. This is also used to create Skynet activity throughout the world through Resistance Alerts. 
* Feature: if a Tech-Comm base is discovered by an Interdiction, Skynet can keep sending additional bombers to attack it - besides shooting down the HKs with crafts/base defenses, to completely stop those attacks it is required either: a) Tech-Comm base is removed/destroyed or b) Skynet makes a ground assault on the base and fails.
* Change: the HK Bases generated at game start can either be Outposts or full bases
* Fixed: Terminator units stuck on roofs should now move, added stairs for access to Hangar and Stores roofs
* Fixed: Training Facility now generates an empty 10x10 map (until building is designed and added to terrain)
V0.32

* Add: Skynet Missile Base facility, can conduct nuclear missile attacks that destroy Tech-Comm bases, currently appears at February for testing, its activated will take longer later
* Add: Skynet tactical missiles and HK bombardments, both destroy facilities on Tech-Comm bases
* Add: Earth based operations, HKs now take off/land at their origin bases
* Add: Reactivate Resistance sector - destroy the workcamp generated by the infiltration and the sector will resume funding
* Change: All continents now start with an HK base already present, instead of just the starting Tech-Comm region
* Change: HK Bases can now generate Interdiction missions (HK Bombardment) but can't spawn Pacification missions
* Change: Skynet Core can now generate Interdiction, Pacification, Termination and Infiltration missions anywhere on the world, plus Transport missions. 
* Change: Pacification missions are now generated through missionScripts, 1-3 possible each month, frequency and chance of happening on region with Tech-Comm base decrease as each mission is generated
* Change: Interdiction missions are now of retaliation type and consist of bombardments made by either HKs or missiles that can destroy 
* Change: Hangar removed from starting base until tactical map is completed

* Skynet terminator weapons now require research before use
* Removed music files, they're now available as a separate download

* Changes to base facility map buildings
** Command Center now uses its intended map (previous version was moved to Housing facility), which should be more defensible, with a more protected escape tunnel. 
** Housing and Storage are the two other alternative starting positions, Housing retains the sewer escape tunnel.
** Added Housing Station and Storage Station, both underground, cost twice to build and at twice the time. Upgraded starting base's facilities to stations for further testing. Also added Tech Lab facility.
** Terminator starting positions should be more evenly distributed around the base
** Terminators can now destroy base facilities by attacking radars, missiles, beds, etc.
