Terminator Future War total conversion for OpenXcom

It is 2027, nearly thirty years after Judgment Day. 

The war against the machines then entered a dangerous phase: in July 1st, 2027 the resistance attacked Cheyenne Mountain in a gamble to destroy Skynet's Core and end the war by taking out the AI's physical presence. After months of preparation and gathering the necessary forces, the resistance forces were able to overcome the complex's massive defenses but the A.I. had long predicted such a move and had already relocated itself to a currently unknown location prior to the attack.

Although successful in taking the complex despite the heavy casualties, the Resistance's victory become a phyrric one after the battle for the Core was won: Skynet has immediately launched a counter-offensive worldwide to terminate key human units and bases, taking advantage that many of its best assets had been redeployed for the Cheyenne Mountain offensive.

It suddenly became shockingly clear then to the rest of the Resistance leaders that for the past year Skynet deliberately reduced its activities while developing new technologies and preparing to deploy new Terminator units and Hunter-Killer craft, while getting ready for a new counterattack destined to crush the Resistance and drive humanity into extinction, as most of their bases and units were suddenly ambushed by Skynet's forces, including their headquarters, which was destroyed with no survivors.Â 

Only only single man remained between Skynet's victory and humanity's survival: John Connor, who had been the single opposition to the Cheyenne Mountain strike among the Resistance leaders. Under his own initiative he had created an elite unit responsible for researching the machines and their technology in order to defeat Skynet and win the war for human survival.

This unit was known as Tech-Comm.
