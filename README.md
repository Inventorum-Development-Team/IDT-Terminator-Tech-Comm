It is 2027, nearly thirty years after Judgment Day. 

The war against the machines has entered a dangerous phase: in 2027 the resistance attacked Cheyenne Mountain in a gamble to destroy Skynet's Core and end the war. After months of preparation and gathering the necessary forces, the resistance forces were able to overcome the complex's massive defenses but the A.I. had long predicted such a move and had already relocated itself to a currently unknown location prior to the attack.

Although successful in taking the complex despite the heavy casualties, the Resistance's victory become a phyrric one after the battle: Skynet immediately launched a counter-offensive worldwide to terminate key resistance units and bases, taking advantage that many assets had been redeployed for the Cheyenne Mountain offensive. While Skynet also failed to take down the Resistance, both sides were left exhausted by the fighting.

For the past year Skynet has reduced its activities, allowing the Resistance groups to recover but reports indicate that the machines have been developing new technologies and mass producing new Terminator units and Hunter-Killer craft, and getting ready for a new offensive destined to crush the Resistance and drive humanity into extinction.

However, at the insistence of John Connor, one of the Resistance's most successful leaders, the human factions have decided to combine their efforts into an elite unit charged with researching the machines' technology in order to defeat Skynet and win the war for human survival.

This unit was known as Tech-Comm.
