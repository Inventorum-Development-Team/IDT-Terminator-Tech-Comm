The People's Liberation Resistance fought hard by four days until a demolition team could blow the dam, sacrifiying itself in the process."

In some groups of the Japanese Resistance, the ancient Bushido resurged as a way of life. This turned the Japanese guerrillas in fierce fighters who fight with discipline and hate towards the machines.

  STR_GRAVEYARD_AIRFORCE: "Graveyard Airforce"
  STR_GRAVEYARD_AIRFORCE_UFOPEDIA: "After Judgment Day, the great airforces of the world powers were lost, either during the initial nuclear exchanges or in the subsequent machine attacks that disabled the remaining military forces and allowed Skynet to gain air superiority throughout the world.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}As the Resistance came together, the destruction of nearly all industry and infrastructure forced its technicians to scavenge the landscape looking for the aircraft that had barely survived: retired models, training/civilian planes and experimental prototypes.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}While the Resistance's motley force would be dismissed by the now dead pre-Judgment Day generals, but under the Resistance it has become a powerful tool against Skynet's aerial Hunter-Killers, and a graveyard for many of its pilots."

Once we complete a sector's comm analysis we'll be able to determine the most interesting areas and send the Blackbird to recon them."
  STR_TECHCOMM_BASES: "Tech-Comm Bases"
  STR_TECHCOMM_BASES_UFOPEDIA: "Over the years the resistance learned to use existing buildings as improvised installations for evading the machines' Hunter-Killer patrols and quickly establish a presence in contested areas.  While the civilian survivors of Judgment Day usually prefer to use existing underground facilities, such as sewers and tunnels, in order to avoid detection, those are inadequate for tech-comm operations and we currently don't possess the means to escavate dedicated facilites.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Tech-Comm bases are centered around the Command Station, which allows access to the underground sewers as a final line of defense and there's also a secondary sewer entry point in usually in buildings used for housing.  During a machine attack, all Tech-Comm and resistance personnel will report to either the Command Center or the Housing/Storage areas, as well as any defense emplacements such as bunkers or guard towers." 
  STR_RESISTANCE_MISSIONS: "Resistance Missions"
  STR_RESISTANCE_MISSIONS_UFOPEDIA: "Skynet's activity usually brings a lot of comm signals, and while most of those serve little propose to Tech-Comm, there will also be missions to defend Resistance and civilians from Skynet attacks that have a three-day window before the machines are successful.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}And when Tech-Comm reestablishes contact with each sector, it will also gain intelligence allowing it to recon and detect potential useful scavenging sites for the Resistance, or high-value Skynet targets.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}However, Skynet regularly uses both type of Resistance missions as bait to set ambushes for bigger targets."

Although our support infrastructure is mainly gone and limited to basic supplies, with signal analysis we should be able recover the techs we need and locate any surviving Resistance assets.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Researching each sector may give us additional resources, and we should also regularly send a recon craft to try to locate any additional supply caches on the area."

We even have been locked out of the backup systems since those have become machine encrypted but with time we can unlock all the data required to manufacture our advanced gear.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Once we restore Sector Comms we'll be able to contact the individual Resistance sectors and might be able to recover any comms related to advanced tech.

  STR_GRENADE: "Frag Grenade"
  STR_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "The Fragmentation Grenade is our standard explosive weapon.  Although a single grenade is typically not enough to stop any of Skynet's units, you may be able to damage the legs of a bipedal unit in order to allow you to escape."
  STR_SMGRENADE: "Smoke Grenade"
  STR_SMGRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "A tactical weapon, the Smoke Grenade puts up a cloud of smoke to mask both your advances and retreats.  Be wary, however, that Skynet's units can use poorly placed smoke clouds against you."

Your best bet is to aim for the underside of the chassis where the armor is thin or the tracks to disable its ability to move.  The blast radius is large, so be sure the area is clear of friendlies."
  STR_PLSGRENADE: "Plasma Grenade"
  STR_PLSGRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Taking advantage of its own technology, Skynet has created a throwable version of its plasma weapons.  When this weapon activates, it unleashes an unfocused burst of plasma that destroys just about anything within its reach."

These termination attacks are capable of crippling entire Resistance sectors and removing their ability to support Tech-Comm.  However, we may still be able to salvage some of the Resistance's material from those abandoned bases."

  STR_SKYNET_TERMINATION_4: "Skynet Termination"
  STR_SKYNET_TERMINATION_UFOPEDIA: "The recent addition of several of Tech-Comm's personnel to Skynet's list of termination targets is a compliment to our successes but also means a grave threat to our operations.  Our success in preventing HK and Terminator activity over a region may result in a termination mission to detect and destroy our bases in the area.  Skynet's bases may also prioritize missions to locate and terminate any Tech-Comm presence in the region."
  STR_SKYNET_PATROL: "Skynet Patrol"
  STR_SKYNET_PATROL_START: "Skynet Patrol"
  STR_SKYNET_PATROL_UFOPEDIA: "In order to maintain its air superiority and secure its ground bases, Skynet deploys HKs specifically dedicated to detect and terminate any human craft present in the region.  These missions can prevent Tech-Com from conducting combat missions over areas where there are machine bases present."

  STR_SKYNET_SUPPLY: "Skynet Supply"
  STR_SKYNET_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA: "Once a new Skynet factory is establised it will run ground convoy missions on a regular basis, acting as a supply center for all machine bases in the region.  Detecting and capturing these convoys will deny vital resources to Skynet while helping the Resistance, but they are also heavily protected by the machines."
  STR_SKYNET_RETRIBUTION: "Skynet Retribution"
  STR_SKYNET_RETRIBUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Although most of the world's nukes were used during Judgment Day, we have long suspected that Skynet has kept a stockpile of nuclear missiles in reserve to hit strategic targets.

#Hunter-Killers
  STR_HUNTER_KILLERS: "Hunter Killers"
  STR_HUNTER_KILLERS_UFOPEDIA: "The first Hunter-Killers deployed by Skynet were unmanned aerial drone, which later gained Vertical Take-Off and Landing abilities as the machines upgraded the initial models with technology based on pre-Judgment Day research."
  STR_HK_DRONE: "HK Drone"
  STR_HK_DRONE_UFOPEDIA: "The HK-50 'Drone' model  was one of Skynet's first aerial AI units, designed to hunt and terminate small targets.  During the initial years of war, the HK-50 was very effective when used together with the early terminator models in detecting and terminating human settlements.  However, Drones can be easily defeated by armed resistance craft."
  STR_HK_AERIAL: "HK Aerial Series"
  STR_HK_AERIAL_UFOPEDIA: "The Hunter-Killer T-100 Aerial series was Skynet's first supersonic VTOL craft, and when introduced it was used extensively to destroy the remaining military units and cities that survived Judgment Day, allowing the machines to secure vast areas.  The basic model is capable of Mach 1.4 and over the years Skynet has introduced several specialized variants as the war progressed."
  STR_HK_SCOUT_1: "HK Scout"
  STR_HK_SCOUT_1_UFOPEDIA: "The T-101 carries additional radar and infrared sensors that allow it to detect targets with twice the range of other HKs.  While the T-101 is less armed or protected than later models, the HK's CPU is very lethal in ambushing resistance transports and support craft and detecting Tech-Comm bases to be later assaulted by heavier craft."
  STR_HK_TRANSPORT_1: "HK Transport"
  STR_HK_TRANSPORT_1_UFOPEDIA: "A dedicated ground-assault version, the T-104 can carry up to eight terminators in its inner cargo bays, which can be equipped for either regular disembarkation or airborne assault.  This HK model is also widely used for Skynet to conduct aerial resupply runs, when it is not used to assault of human settlements or resistance installations."
  STR_HK_FIGHTER_1: "HK Fighter"
  STR_HK_FIGHTER_1_UFOPEDIA: "Like its predecessor, the T-102 was designed for termination of both ground or air human targets and its appearance will be feared by all Resistance fighters and pilots.  This HK is used to attack Resistance forces and protect Skynet's bases and less armed HKs."
  STR_HK_BOMBER_1: "HK Attack"
  STR_HK_BOMBER_1_UFOPEDIA: "The T-103 HK Attack is used by Skynet to bombard hardened targets or large concentrations of humans, but is vulnerable during its attack run."
  STR_HK_INTERCEPTOR_1: "HK Interceptor"
  STR_HK_INTERCEPTOR_1_UFOPEDIA: "While initially confused by as an updated version of the T-101 Scout, battle salvage from HK bases later revealed that the craft was actually an interceptor version and capable of outrunning nearly all human aircraft. T-107 models are feared by all Resistance pilots, which have given it the unofficial nickname of 'Widowmaker'."
  STR_HK_VTOL: "HK VTOL Series"
  STR_HK_VTOL_UFOPEDIA: "Reports from the field indicate that Skynet has deployed a newer Hunter-Killer type, designed specifically with improved speed, armor and weaponry."

  STR_TACTICAL_MISSILE: "Tactical Missile"
  STR_TACTICAL_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "Skynet deploys Tactical Ballistic Missiles whenever required to soften hardened Resistance targets before assulting them with Terminators. If they successfully penetrate the base defenses, the missile attacks will damage facilities and eventually destroy them, unless the HK Base firing them is destroyed first."
  STR_MX_MISSILE: "MX Missile"
  STR_MX_MISSILE_UFOPEDIA: "The MX was once the most advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile ever deployed by the USA and it was used extensively by Skynet during Judgment Day and afterwards to hit human targets across the entire globe. It is unknown how many missiles Skynet still have under its possession but a single one is sufficient to destroy any Resistance base on the planet within its massive range."
  STR_SKYNET_CONVOY: "Skynet Convoy"
  STR_SKYNET_CONVOY_UFOPEDIA: "Once a new machine base is establised it will run supply missions on a semi-regular basis. with the Skynet Core acting as the central hub between all primary bases who then act as regional distribution centers.  Detecting and capturing these convoys will deny vital resources to Skynet while helping the Resistance, but they are also heavily protected by the machines."
  STR_TERMINATOR: "Terminators"
  STR_TERMINATOR_UFOPEDIA: "The Terminator series consist of humanoid unmanned combat models designed initially by the US military for peacekeeping roles and adapted by Skynet for its needs. The initial the T-100 model is no longer used by Skynet, and the current ones extend up to the current T-600. In addition, the machines also use non-human ground models which are also known as Hunter-Killers, like their aerial deadlier cousins."

But the most powerful tool may be its Tin Man A.I., installed in a CPU set for write-only to enhance its ability to pass as a human by learning their behavior. Ultimately it seems it also gave the T-1000 prototype self-sentience, which caused Skynet to stop development of the project."
