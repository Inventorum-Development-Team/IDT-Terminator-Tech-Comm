  STR_RESISTANCE_ORDER_1: "Comm Report - Destroy HK Base"
  STR_RESISTANCE_ORDER_1_UFOPEDIA: "General,{NEWLINE}Now that Tech-Comm is operational, we have no time to waste. We have been taking heavy losses in your sector from an Hunter-Killer base whose location we have been unable to determine, so your primary task is locate and destroy this facility.{NEWLINE}In addition, Skynet has been busy terminating up the human population, so liberating any workcamps or stopping machine attacks will also be a major help to the Resistance on this sector.{NEWLINE}You should expect aerial HK activity – be careful."
  STR_RESISTANCE_ORDER_2: "Version 2.0"
  STR_RESISTANCE_ORDER_2_UFOPEDIA: "General,{NEWLINE}The data recovered from the HK Base indicate that Skynet has deployed a new automated factory capable of mass producing all types of machines and new facilities. The longer this factory is active, the more it will deploy additional HK bases and workcamps – your objective is to locate and destroy this facility while recovering addtional intel on Skynet's plans."
  STR_RESISTANCE_ORDER_3: "Comm Report - Destroy Laboratory"
  STR_RESISTANCE_ORDER_3_UFOPEDIA: "General,{NEWLINE}Our analysis of the factory indicates that Skynet has made several technological breakthroughs regarding nanomachines and advanced materials that allow it to quickly assemble these facilities and deploy them anywhere on the world in a matter of months. The new estimates now indicate that the machines will be able to restore their strength prior to Cheyenne Mountain in a matter of months, instead of years. It will be necessary to expand Tech-Comm's presence throughout the world to locate and destroy these bases before Skynet gains full control of those regions. "

  STR_TECH_COMM: "Tech-Comm"
  STR_TECH_COMM_UFOPEDIA: "Tech-comm units were initially deployed by the resistance groups as a way to gather intel from the machines' communications and learn to use their own technology to defeat Skynet.  Several tech-comm teams played a critical role in responding to the machine counterattacks during the battle of Cheyenne Mountain and preventing the encirclement and annihilation of the resistance forces assaulting the complex.{NEWLINE}In the aftermath of the battle, the resistance leaders realized the need to centralize their tech-comm efforts into a unified command to neutralize Skynet's strategic advantage.{NEWLINE}Tech-Comm is equipped with the best available personnel and craft to conduct operations against Skynet and recover technology and communications useful to defeat the machines, while supporting other human fighters in the field."
  STR_RESISTANCE_PERSONNEL: "Resistance Personnel"
  STR_RESISTANCE_PERSONNEL_UFOPEDIA: "Tech-Comm personnel consists of combat fighters and craft pilots recruited within the ranks of the Resistance.  In addition, its bases also house comm specialists responsible for signal analysis and intel, and technicians in charge of manufacturing any weapons or gear required to supply our planes and fighters.{NEWLINE}Other resistance fighters may also be present in combat missions to provide assistance, although those fellow soldiers will be under the command of their respective sector leaders."
  STR_RESISTANCE_CRAFT: "The Graveyard Airforce"
  STR_RESISTANCE_CRAFT_UFOPEDIA: "After Judgment Day, the great airforces of the world powers were lost, either during the initial nuclear exchanges or in the subsequent machine attacks that disabled the remaining military forces and allowed Skynet to gain air superiority throughout the world.{NEWLINE}Once the Resistance came together, the destruction of nearly all industry and infrastructure forced its technicians to scavenge the landscape looking for the aircraft that had barely survived: retired models, training/civilian planes and experimental prototypes.  Such a motley force would be dismissed by the now dead pre-Judgment Day generals, but under the Resistance it has become a powerful tool against Skynet's aerial Hunter-Killers, and a graveyard for many of its pilots.{NEWLINE}While the Resistance has been able to build individual aircraft on its workshops based on recovered blueprints, it is impossible for them to properly support Tech-Comm's needs on this matter - to get additional planes we'll have to resort to the scrapyard, as always."
  STR_TECH_COMM_BASES: "Tech-Comm Bases"
  STR_TECH_COMM_BASES_UFOPEDIA: "Over the years the resistance learned to use existing buildings as improvised installations for evading the machines' hunter-killer patrols and quickly establish a presence in contested areas.  While the civilian survivors of Judgment Day usually prefer to use existing underground facilities, such as sewers and tunnels, in order to avoid detection, those are inadequate for tech-comm operations and we currently don't possess the means to escavate dedicated facilites.{NEWLINE}Tech-Comm bases are centered around the Command Station, which allows access to the underground sewers as a final line of defense and there's also a secondary sewer entry point in usually in buildings used for housing.  During a machine attack, all tech-comm and resistance personnel will report to either the Command Center or the Housing/Storage areas, as well as any defense emplacements such as bunkers or guard towers."

  STR_SECTOR_01_COMM: "Sector Intel 01/Northern"
  STR_SECTOR_01_COMM_UFOPEDIA: "Canada, because of its closeness to USA, was also badly hit on Judgment Day. The victory at Cheyenne Mountain also helped the Canadian resistance by smoothing Skynet's attacks. They are concentrated primarily in Edmonton, in the ruins of CFB Cold Lake and the outskirts of Vancouver. Weapons and equipment have been recovered from the CFB Montreal, but other CFBs have been catalogued as Skynet traps by Resistance recon."

Since the beginning of the war, the Brazilian resistance fights in the Amazon, which has caused Skynet to constantly defoliate complete hectares to eliminate their refuges. Some of the former army's depot has been recovered by scouts, with usable armored vehicles and many guns and ammunition. The docked aircraft carrier Minas Gerais serve as the Brazilian Resistance HQ, hidden from Skynet with radar and sensor jammers located in the ship."

Currently, the main groups of the Resistance operate in the Alps, in the Black Forest in Germany and in the Scottish Highlands, doing guerrilla in areas where Skynet can't attack with their ground forces. A large battle occurried a year ago when a large contingent of HKs attacked a Resistance base in Verdun, resulting in a siege that lasted for three weeks. An Anglo-French counterattack was mounted as Operation: Crimson Fury and assaulted by surprise the machines. Was one of the first major victories in European mainland. This is where the M83 Pincer Grenade HCC proved itself as a capable weapon."

We have reports of scattered Resistance groups fighting in Karelian forests, on the rubble of Moscow and recently secured an oil reserve in the Caucasus. Some of the survivors of Moscow took refuge in the Metro and contact has been made with them, they serve as observers and stalkers of the Skynet forces in the city. Due the large territory, the Resistance has three HQs, Southern Command located in Sevastopol Naval Base, Central Command located in the outskirts of Moscow and Northern Command, in Vyborg. After a large Skynet offensive in 2022, the Resistance was pushed back of St. Petersburg, so NorthComm was relocated in the Karelian Isthmus."

  STR_SKYNET_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "As part of its strategy to eliminate humanity, Skynet has been pursuing a technological edge over its enemies and it has been establishing research bases throughout the planet disguised as workcamps.  These bases are then assigned to a specific research field, usually testing its deadly creations on available live human captives."

  STR_SKYNET_RECLAMATION_UFOPEDIA: "When establishing itself on a new region, Skynet will establish bases to collect raw and transformed materials, who then will be transformed into new machines and installations or shipped elsewhere to fuel the machine expansion.  If necessary, Skynet will use captive humans as slave labor to speed up the recollection process, and terminate them when no longer required."
  STR_SKYNET_EXPANSION: "Skynet Expansion"
  STR_SKYNET_EXPANSION_UFOPEDIA:  "When expanding itself to a new area the machines will build first a primary base to enlarge their presence.  These automated factory bases will then create additional outposts to capture humans into workcamps and hunter-killer bases terminate any Resistance presence in the region.  Destroying these factories is critical to stop the machines' advance."
  STR_SKYNET_ERADICATION: "Skynet Eradication"
  STR_SKYNET_ERADICATION_UFOPEDIA: "As part of its genocide, the machines target populated areas for capture and/or termination of all humans by HK and Terminator units, regardless of them being civilians or armed fighters.

  STR_SKYNET_INFILTRATION_UFOPEDIA:  "Skynet's tactics of infiltrating human groups to destroy them from within have been previously known and countered by the Resistance.  However, recent machine attacks indicate that Skynet is fielding a new type of infiltrator to locate and infiltrate entire sectors, despite the Resistance's heightened security measures.  These termination attacks are capable of crippling entire Resistance sectors and removing their ability to support Tech-Comm.  However, we may still be able to salvage some of the Resistance's material from those abandoned bases."

  STR_SKYNET_TERMINATION_UFOPEDIA:  "The recent addition of several of Tech-Comm's personnel to Skynet's list of termination targets is a compliment to our successes but also means a grave threat to our operations.  Our success in preventing HK and Terminator activity over a region may result in a termination mission to detect and destroy our bases in the area.  Skynet's bases may also prioritize missions to locate and terminate any Tech-Comm presence in the region."
  STR_SKYNET_PATROL: "Skynet Patrol"
  STR_SKYNET_PATROL_START: "Skynet Patrol"
  STR_SKYNET_PATROL_UFOPEDIA:  "In order to maintain its air superiority and secure its ground bases, Skynet deploys HKs specifically dedicated to detect and terminate any human craft present in the region.

  STR_SKYNET_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA: "Once a new Skynet factory is establised it will run ground convoy missions on a regular basis, acting as a supply center for all machine bases in the region.  Detecting and capturing these convoys will deny vital resources to Skynet while helping the Resistance, but they are also heavily protected by the machines."
  STR_SKYNET_RETRIBUTION: "Skynet Retribution"
  STR_SKYNET_RETRIBUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Although most of the world's nukes were used during Judgment Day, we have long suspected that Skynet has kept a stockpile of nuclear missiles in reserve to hit strategic targets.

  STR_HK_DRONE: "HK Drone"
  STR_HK_DRONE_UFOPEDIA: "The HK-50 'Drone' model  was one of Skynet's first aerial AI units, designed to hunt and terminate small targets.  During the initial years of war, the HK-100 was very effective when used together with the early terminator models in detecting and terminating human settlements.  However, Drones can be easily defeated by armed resistance craft."
  STR_HK_AERIAL: "HK_Aerial Series"
  STR_HK_AERIAL_UFOPEDIA: "The Hunter-Killer Aerial series was Skynet's first supersonic VTOL craft, and when introduced it was used extensively to destroy the remaining military units and cities that survived Judgment Day, allowing the machines to secure vast areas.  The basic model is capable of Mach 1.4 and over the years Skynet has introduced several variants to the basic model."
  STR_HK_SCOUT_1: "HK Scout"
  STR_HK_SCOUT_1_UFOPEDIA: "The T-205 carries additional radar and infrared sensors that allow it to detect targets with twice the range of other HKs.  While the T-205 is less armed or protected than a T-207, the HK's CPU is very lethal in ambushing resistance transports and support craft and detecting Tech-Comm bases to be later assaulted by heavier craft."
  STR_HK_TRANSPORT_1: "HK Transport"
  STR_HK_TRANSPORT_1_UFOPEDIA: "A dedicated ground-assault version, the T-204 can carry up to eight terminators in its inner cargo bays, which can be equipped for either regular disembarkation or airborne assault.  This HK model is also widely used for Skynet to conduct aerial resupply runs, when it is not used to assault of human settlements or resistance installations."
  STR_HK_FIGHTER_1: "HK Fighter"
  STR_HK_FIGHTER_1_UFOPEDIA: "Like its predecessor, the T-206 was created specifically for termination of any human target and its appearance will be feared by most resistance fighters and pilots.  This HK is used to attack Resistance forces and protect Skynet's bases and less armed HKs."
